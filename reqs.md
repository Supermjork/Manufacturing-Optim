# Enhancing Supply Chain Visibility through Manufacturing Analytics

## Instructions

To design and develop a data-driven solution that improves supply chain visibility by automating risk management processes and accelerating insights related to suppliers, logistics, and raw materials. This project aims to enhance the resilience and efficiency of the manufacturing value chain.

## Project Requirements

1. Understanding Supply Chain Visibility:
    - Conduct research to define the key aspects of supply chain visibility.
    - Identify challenges in current supply chain operations, particularly in risk management and insights generation.

2. Automated Risk Management:
    - Analyze risk factors affecting suppliers, logistics, and raw materials.
    - Propose an automated system that flags risks based on predefined criteria (e.g., supplier delays, raw material shortages, or logistical disruptions).
    - Suggest how machine learning models or rule-based systems can be utilized for real-time risk prediction.

3. Data Collection and Analysis:
    - Define the types of data needed for supply chain analytics (e.g., supplier performance metrics, transportation schedules, raw material quality).
    - Create a sample dataset or identify a source of realistic supply chain data.
    - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights.

4. Insight Acceleration:
    - Design a dashboard or report that visualizes critical supply chain metrics.
    - Include real-time updates for key indicators like lead times, stock levels, and risk alerts.
    - Ensure the system provides actionable recommendations for decision-makers.

5. Value Chain Resilience:
    - Evaluate how the proposed solution improves supply chain resilience.
    - Discuss measures to mitigate identified risks proactively.
    - Highlight the potential financial and operational benefits.

## Deliverables

1. Report (in PDF format):
    - Detailed explanation of your approach to improving supply chain visibility.
    - Description of risk management automation and insight acceleration methods.
    - Analysis of your findings and their implications on the manufacturing process.

2. Presentation (PowerPoint):
    - Summarize the project's key aspects, including objectives, methods, and results.
    - Include visual aids like charts, graphs, or sample dashboard screenshots.

3. Technical Component :
    - Provide a prototype or simulation of the proposed solution (e.g., a simple Python script or a visualization tool).
    - Share the code and documentation.
